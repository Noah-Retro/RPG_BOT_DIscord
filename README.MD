# Open RPG

Hey! This project is an RPG for Discord, where you can easy add new items, reccepies, dungeons, raids, weapons etc. you get the point. It is an Open RPG so the main focus was on expandebilyti and some what on gameplay. Over the next few months i d'like to work more on the fight mechanics and the social side of the bot.


# Usage

You can invite the bot on your server and play imidiatly! After creating a character.

## Commands

Since the new Discord polacy changes all commands are now applicationcommands. This means, you invoke a command with ` /commandname subcommandname [kwargs]`. Even though it may seams complicated to you at first glanz, it will provide you with a nice overview of what commands are avaieble and how to use them. And even if you have multyple bots on your server you get distinguan betwean them.

## Whats after the release

After collecting enough feedback and experence what the player want to customice, the plan is to release an standalone game with the data collected. 

### What is the purpose of the discord bot

It is an test phase for how well it is reseaved, how the player interact with the open assets and how much it is used. If the players don't like to create own assets, storys and so on, it was just an year of wasted time instead of multiple years and money.
